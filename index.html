    <h2>My basics</h2>
	<p>  
        I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I'm married, born in Norway but live in Wigan. I have lived here for <span id="live-time"></span> years. I'm half british. I have one <span id="baby-age"></span> month old son.
    </p>
	<h2>My simple rules</h2>
	  
        <ul>
            <li>Don't be a dick</li>
            <li>Don't ask to ask</li>
            <li>A work place should be a fun place to work</li>
            <li> Relax, it's going to be fine</li>
        </ul>


	<h2>How I work</h2>
    <p> 
        My work/career is just part of me, I don't have a strict work/life separation. This means that sometimes I might be mowing the grass during work hours, and sometimes
        I will write some code on a quiet night on the couch.
        I have core hours between 9am and 2pm where I will generally be within 10 minutes of my desk.
        Outside these hours I might be painting a fence, trimming the hedges or playing with my son.

    </p>
	
	<h2>How I communicate</h2>
    <p>
        
        I always communicate directly, and rarely bother with the pleasantries (it's a cultural thing). I'm happy to have some small talk, but it should be <i>after</i> any business has been dealt with.
        It's always easiest to reach me in written form, preferably using async communication. I prefer communication in the following order:

    <ol>
        <li>Slack</li>
        <li>Whatsapp/Text</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Homing pigeon</li>
        <li>Phone call</li>
    </ol>
    Note that email might take longer to get a reply, I don't check my email more than 2-3 times a day,
    and don't have any notifications turned on.
    </p>

	<h2>How to get on my good side</h2>
    <p>    
        If you have something you need help with, always give me as much information as possible.
        I can decide what is relevant to me once I have the complete picture. Always try to include as much context as possible too.
    </p>
	
	<h2>What annoys me</h2>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>People coming to me with problems without having tried a solution first. I'm always happy to help, but I would like to know what <b>hasn't </b>worked first.</li>
            <li>People who take things too seriously. I live by the lyrics of "always look on the bright side of life". If you can't laugh at it, what can you do?</li>
            <li>Unnecessary meetings that should have been an email</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
